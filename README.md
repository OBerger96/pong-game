# Pong Game

Build a pong game where human players can play against a CPU opponent. 
The human players' paddle is programmed to move as the motion of the mouse.
The opponent's paddle is programmed to track the ball, making the level of play more difficult.
The ball's speed increases every time it hits the paddle.
The direction of the ball is reversed and changes slightly every time it hits the paddle.
